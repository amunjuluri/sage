Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data\n2. Inheritance: Ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from another class\n3. Polymorphism: Ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms\n4. Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features\n\nThese principles help in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code.',
